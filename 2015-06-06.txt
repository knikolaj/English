Some sports are extremely dangerous but many people still like them very much. Why do people take part in these sports. Give some suggestion how to deal with these dangers. Give reasons for your answer'.
I think that an every man have an own reason why he or she participate in extreme sports, but I could try to presume over psychological reasons. We all have the same but different bodies, and we have a different level of testosterone in our blood. If you have a lot of testosterone it stimulate you to be more aggressive or stand yourself in extreme situations to lay it down for a while.
In modern world extreme kind of sports probably is most socially acceptable way to lose excess of testosterone. Hundred years ago that kind of people participate in wars, common fights, conquered new territories. And now they climb in mountains, jump with wingsuits, play strikeball and so on.
I don't think that we should to deal something with that. That is the human right to take a risk. But probably we should explain in schools that we have a difference inside our bodies and if they want they could try to learn how to manage better with themselves.
And may be in the future we could manage to production testosterone and other hormones in our bodies with a special pills or etc.

Just the test by prose.
